**Data-enabled learning with exit**  
*Abstract*:  This paper analyzes a duopoly competition model with data-enabled learning and incorporates the probability that firms may exit, providing a rationale for the losing firm to stay in the market. Specifically, we derive a new equilibrium in which the losing firm always has a positive value and prices more aggressively. We also find that exit probability affects consumer surplus by increasing the chance of monopolization and shifting subsidies from firms. Finally, we show that exit probability dampens data sharing policies.

**Freemium in two-sided market**  
*Abstract*: This paper uses a general model to analyze the optimal menu pricing strategies in two-sided markets, especially the adoption conditions for the freemium model. In this framework, platforms have the option to generate revenue through premium fees from customers or by offering free services/products in exchange for advertising income. Our findings indicate that the asymmetrical density of customers' preference for the platform and the high willingness-to-pay exhibited by advertisers are necessary conditions for freemium to emerge as the optimal pricing strategy. 

### Work in Progress

**Market share in a dynamic competition model: a numerical approach**  
*Abstract*: This paper aims to use a numerical approach to compare the market share of different types of firms within the framework of a dynamic competition model with data-enabled learning. In this scenario, incumbent firms, equipped with more data for learning, and entrant firms, with faster learning speeds, compete dynamically to gain more market share and advantages. We are using Python to simulate the competition results under a symmetric shock.
