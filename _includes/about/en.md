I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Economics](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/ecs/), [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).
My research interests lie in the fields of digital economy, industrial organization and applied microeconomic theory.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I earned my master's degree in applied economics at [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu/).
During my undergraduate years, I studied environmental economics and management at [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/).
